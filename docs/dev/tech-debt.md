# Tech debt

Known shortcuts, gaps and duplication, so they are fixed on purpose rather
than rediscovered. Add an entry when you leave one behind; delete it in the
PR that fixes it. One entry: what, where, why it matters, the fix.

## Near-duplicate code below the lint threshold

CI runs `dupl` at 150 tokens. At 100 tokens it still finds two pairs:
`internal/tui/catalog/specs.go` (two eight-line column blocks) and
`internal/tui/history.go` (two fifteen-line blocks). Small, but agents copy
what they find. Fix: extract the shared part, then lower the threshold.

## Live Debugger snapshot fields are unvalidated

`docs/dev/learnings.md` marks the `application.snapshots` facts as taken
from dtctl's implementation and not yet validated live by dtui; the host,
process and trace association fields are read tolerantly in
`internal/tui/catalog/livedebugger.go`. Fix: validate on a tenant with
Live Debugger data and update the learnings entry.

## learnings.md is one long file

`docs/dev/learnings.md` is over 1,700 lines, so an agent looking for one fact
loads all of it or greps. Fix: keep the section numbering stable and, if it
keeps growing, split section 1 (DQL facts) by data object.
