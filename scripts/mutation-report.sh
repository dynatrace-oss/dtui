# Efficacy = killed / (killed + lived): of the mutants a test executes, how
# many make a test fail. A LIVED mutant is a logic change the suite does not
# notice. The threshold only applies when there is something to judge (at
# least one killed or lived mutant), so a docs-only diff passes. The summary
# is appended to $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY when set (GitHub Actions).
